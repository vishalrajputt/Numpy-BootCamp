# Numpy-BootCamp
A comprehensive collection of resources and tutorials for learning the NumPy library in Python.

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. 
It provides a wide range of tools and functions for working with arrays, matrices, 
and numerical operations. 
Some of the key features of NumPy include:

An efficient array object called ndarray, for fast array computations
Mathematical functions for performing operations on arrays such as trigonometric, logarithmic, etc
Broadcasting functions for performing operations on arrays of different shapes
Linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number generation capabilities
Interoperability with other popular scientific libraries such as SciPy and Matplotlib
The ndarray (n-dimensional array) object is the most important feature of NumPy. 
It provides a convenient and efficient way to store and manipulate large arrays of homogeneous 
data (i.e. data of the same type, such as integers or floating point values). 
NumPy arrays are more memory efficient and faster than Python lists, 
and they also allow for more complex and efficient operations.



# Here is a cheat sheet for common NumPy operations:

## Creating arrays:

np.array(object): Create an array from a list, tuple, or other array-like object.
np.zeros(shape): Create an array of zeros with the given shape.
np.ones(shape): Create an array of ones with the given shape.
np.eye(n): Create an identity matrix of size n x n.
np.arange(start, stop, step): Create an array with evenly spaced values within a given range.
np.linspace(start, stop, num): Create an array with num evenly spaced values within a given range.

## Array attributes:

array.shape: Get the shape of an array (number of rows, number of columns).
array.size: Get the total number of elements in an array.
array.dtype: Get the data type of the elements in an array.
array.ndim: Get the number of dimensions in an array.
Array indexing and slicing:

array[index]: Get an element at a specific index.
array[start:stop:step]: Get a slice of an array, with optional start and stop indices and step size.
array[:, index]: Get a specific column from a 2D array.
array[index, :]: Get a specific row from a 2D array.

## Array operations:

array + value: Add a value to each element in an array.
array * value: Multiply each element in an array by a value.
array1 + array2: Add two arrays element-wise.
array1 * array2: Multiply two arrays element-wise.
np.dot(array1, array2): Perform matrix multiplication between two arrays.
array.sum(): Get the sum of all elements in an array.
array.mean(): Get the mean of all elements in an array.
array.min(): Get the minimum value in an array.
array.max(): Get the maximum value in an array.

## Broadcasting:

array + value: Add a scalar value to each element in an array.
array1 + array2: Perform element-wise addition between two arrays of the same shape.
reshaping and transpose

array.reshape(shape): Reshape an array to the given shape.
array.T : Transpose of array
This cheat sheet provides a quick reference for some of the most common NumPy operations, but keep in mind that NumPy is a powerful library with many more functions and options available. You can refer to the official documentation for more information on using NumPy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/
